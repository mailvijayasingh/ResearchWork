{"reviewTxt": "This is perfect for my motorcycle.  I use it to charge my phone and it comes in handy when using navigation.  Often times if I use the device for navigation by the time I get to where I'm going the phone is nearly dead.  This keeps the charge up so I can actually use my phone when I get to where I'm traveling to.  Another nice feature is the on off switch on the side of the unit.  This allows me not to have to unplug the device if it's fully charged which helps in not over heating the device and overcharging.  The last feature which is often overlooked is the USB rubber flap. This is also very important.  I can park the bike and unplug the phone, close the flap and if it rains I don't have to worry about ruining the port.  I used to use a different charger which I loved very much, however I would always forget to remove it from the motorcycle and on the off chance I hit bad weather water would get in the USB port and I would have to replace it.  This unit I don't have to do that.  As long as I close the flap I can leave it on the bike 24/7. All year around.

{"reviewTxt": "I read every single review here before I purchased this product, and I so wanted it to work! The design is dainty; it is sleek, simple, and portable. Alas, try as I might, I couldn't get the device to deliver on the functionalities attributed to it by the manufacturer and reviewers. I performed all manner of tests on the device. I adhered to the recommended five-hour charging before use, but that did nothing to propel the charge on my Galaxy Note 3 even a fraction of a percentage forward. So I left the device to charge overnight and tried again the next morning. That didn't help.  I turned my Note off and tried recharging. That didn't help either. I drained the charge off the Note and again tried recharging. That still didn't help.  I tested different cables, different outlets, different devices such as my iPod and iPad--all to no avail. Consequently, I'm convinced that the claims here are either downright bogus, or I'm just one unlucky customer. I honestly hope that it's the latter. After all, we wouldn't want some unsuspecting customer to find himself stranded and in critical need of some battery power before he learns that the supposedly life-saving device was virtually inutile.

{"reviewTxt": "This is a GREAT product.  The item was delivered extremely QUICK, exactly as described by the seller. I needed a \"trickle charge connector to USB charger\" that would provide a charging capability for my iPhone, GPS, Bluetooth devices, etc., that are usually with me when I ride my motorcycle.  Since I use BOTH the Bluetooth AND the GPS functions from my iPhone while riding, and also sometimes listening to music/making/taking phone calls, the battery has the potential to go quick.  As such, its important to be able to have a manner that provides juice when needed if the iPhone battery goes dead and you do not have access to a charging solution. Once connected to the trickle charge connector, depending on the length of the USB cable being used, there is the potential to strategically route the cable to one of your saddle bags so it is available for use and out of the way of operating the motorcycle.  In addition, this product came with an ADDED BENEFIT that was not listed in the product listing.  When this product is connected to the trickle charge connector, there is \"constant power\" flowing through the cable to the USB female connection at the end.  What this means is that when the bike is OFF, there is STILL POWER going to the end connection so that you can CHARGE any of your devices while NOT wasting gas or while you are waiting.  You can also charge a device while riding when it is plugged into the USB female connection. On a down note, there is only ONE USB connection.  I do not take a star off for that as this is EXACTLY what the product comes with and I knew that in advance.  However, it would be a better product with TWO female USB connection options so that TWO devices can be charged at the same time. I would HIGHLY recommend this product to ALL motorcycle riders who need an easy way to connect a SINGLE device to the trickle charge connector.  Wether you think you need it or not, this is a great product to have on ALL motorcycles as the LAST thing you want to do is run into a situation where you NEED a phone and it is dead with no way to charge it.  Plus, as an ADDED benefit, this product is substantially LESS expensive when compared to Harley Davidson OEM products of a similar nature, or even third party options.", "verifiedPurchase": true, "title": "Trickle Charge Connector to USB Port for Motorcycle Device Charging", "timestamp": "2016-08-31 11:49:54", "vine": false, "starRating": 5.0, "memberId": "A6ATLTYXSTD5B", "nComments": 0, "date": "on April 26, 2016", "productId": "B01746K4V2", "id": "R2ZH1SA78U931G", "helpful": [1]}

{"reviewTxt": "Initial review: I received this quickly, plugged it in, and am happy to say that it works fine so far with my iPhone 6. Having a power switch is a very valuable addition to prevent your battery from draining if you don't ride your bike for extended periods. Notably, I bought this after buying two Battery Tender SAE to USB adapters (http://www.amazon.com/Battery-Tender-081-0158-Disconnect-Charger/dp/B00DJ5KEF4/), each of which failed after just a couple of weeks. Let's hope that this lasts for longer. I'll post an update after I've lived with it for a while. To make a clean-looking installation, I simply used black wire ties to a nearby cable. By the way: you should NEVER connect any devices to your bike battery without a fuse in the line. This product on Amazon (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NCOKZQ) is a good choice. ======== UPDATE (as promised). I really wanted this work, but it failed after two weeks of use - no better than the BatteryTender. No power is delivered to the USB port anymore. This unit has not been abused, or exposed to the elements. I see that \"Abegail\" has commented below that they will stand by the product.

{"reviewTxt": "From the description, I thought this would be a high speed charger for my iphone 5 which would speed up charging. It is not. It is just another run of the mill, standard amperage car charger. I had a regular car charger already, so I sent this back and ordered one of the actual higher amperage chargers that has many better features. The higher amp charger I finally found charges my iphone 3 times faster than the standard charger, and it saves power. When the phone is fully charged, it virtually stops drawing power. It has a lighted red outline on the body of the charger that lights up when the phone is charging and goes dark when charging is done. The red light also makes it easy to see the charger in the dark, and it's all the way around a better product. It costs about $10 more, but it's worth it. I'm embarrassed to have been misled into thinking this was a fast charger.

{"reviewTxt": "I have gone through so many chargers for my phones.

High quality construction.  And I was really amazed at how fast it charged.  I was not expecting that at all.  This is really a high quality product.
